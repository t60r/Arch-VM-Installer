#Goal

The goal of this project is to offer a more relaxed environment when installing an Arch Linux VM.  This set of scripts will cut down on user input while following general good practices of installation.  Coming soon...VM Extensions!?

#INSTALLATION

1.  Boot a live iso of Arch Linux
2.  `wget http://7.ly/prechroot`
3.  `source prechroot` and keep an eye out for the occasional need for input
4.  Follow the instructions, and look at the prompts.
5.  See the MIT License
